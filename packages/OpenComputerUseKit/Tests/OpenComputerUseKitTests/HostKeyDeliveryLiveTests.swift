///         swift test --filter HostKeyDeliveryLiveTests
///
/// `CGEventPostToPid` delivers whatever the executor put on the event, and the
/// executor put no characters on it. A key code is half an event; the character
/// is the half an application acts on, and an application that is not frontmost
/// does not supply it for itself. `typeText` set the string and worked;
/// `pressKey` never did, so every `{ "kind": "key" }` this executor ever posted
/// did nothing, reported `outcome: ok`, and told the model a request had
/// succeeded that could not have. §14 measured it one key at a time and this
/// vector is the standing assertion.
///
/// The unit half asserts the event carries the character AppKit binds rather
/// than the layout's translation of the key code. It cannot assert the
/// application acts on it, and the two are different claims: an executor that
/// sets the character but posts to the wrong place passes the unit half.
///
/// **The target is never activated.** That is the difference between this vector
/// and 53, which activates deliberately to measure a *verdict* without delivery
/// confounding it. Here delivery is the subject, and background delivery is the
/// only delivery this protocol allows: §6.4 forbids activating the application,
/// raising its window or changing the frontmost app. The frontmost pid is
/// asserted unchanged across the whole run, which is what makes the effects
/// below evidence of a key that landed in the background rather than of a
/// foreground the test quietly took.
///
/// Escape is not asserted here, and its absence is a measurement rather than an
/// omission. On a background `NSTextView` it reaches `cancelOperation:`, whose
/// answer is a completion panel — and measured, no window at any layer appears
/// for the target while it is not the active application, so this fixture cannot
/// tell a delivered Escape from a dropped one. It was measured elsewhere and it
/// lands: posted at a background Calculator, `Escape` cleared the entry two
/// digit keys had just put in the display, with the frontmost application
/// unchanged throughout. Calculator is not a vector here because its focused
/// element does not appear in the observation at all — `focusedElementToken` is
/// `nil` — so `dispatch.key`, which requires one, cannot address it.
///
/// The document is this test's own, in the temporary directory. TextEdit is left
/// running; only the window this test opened is closed, and its changes are
/// discarded.
///
/// Every wait here is a semaphore. `wait(for:)` and `RunLoop.run` both spin the
/// main run loop, which thaws exactly the timings a live test exists to catch —
/// the executor's main thread sits in `readLine` and spins nothing.
