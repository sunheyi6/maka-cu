///
/// Three of the four things asserted here are invisible to a fixture, and the
/// third is the one that would have shipped broken:
///
/// 1. A menu element's `frame` is suppressed. The value being suppressed is one
///    AppKit puts on a *real* unopened menu item — a degenerate `(0, 982, 0, 0)`
///    — and no fake node produces it, so a walk that forgot to suppress it looks
///    identical to one that did against every fixture in the suite.
/// 2. The suppression is applied at **both** ends of §4.3. The walk records the
///    frame and the dispatch-time probe recomputes it, and an executor that
///    suppressed it on the way out but not on the way back refuses every menu
///    dispatch `element_changed` / `changed: ["frame"]` — on an element nothing
///    has touched, on every application. This is the third time that seam has
///    been the defect; the first two were `ancestorRoles`.
/// 3. `AXPress` reaches a menu item of an application that is not in front, and
///    reaches it without putting it there.
///
/// Calculator is the target because `显示 > 基础` and `显示 > 科学` are a
/// reversible pair whose effect is visible from *outside* the application — the
/// window resizes — so "did it land" is a measurement rather than a judgement.
/// That matters more here than anywhere else in this suite: a menu press with a
/// side effect the test cannot undo is not a test, it is damage. Nothing here
/// presses an item that saves, deletes, prints, quits or opens a panel.
///
/// It is launched in the background and left running: this test does not own it.
///
/// Every wait is a semaphore. `wait(for:)` and `RunLoop.run` both spin the main
/// run loop, which thaws exactly the timings a live test exists to catch — the
/// executor's main thread sits in `readLine` and spins nothing.
