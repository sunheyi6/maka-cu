/// path makes — so this vector can be pointed at the user's own windows without
/// pressing anything in them.
///
/// System Settings is launched, in the background, because it is the window the
/// numbers came from: it hosts its panes in another process, so every element of
/// its digest crosses XPC and one look at it costs more than half the budget. It
/// is left running afterwards, as vector 51 leaves Preview running — this test
/// does not own the user's applications.
///
/// Every wait here is a semaphore. `wait(for:)` and `RunLoop.run` both spin the
/// main run loop; the executor's main thread sits in `readLine` and spins
/// nothing, so a live test that leans on a run loop is measuring a process that
