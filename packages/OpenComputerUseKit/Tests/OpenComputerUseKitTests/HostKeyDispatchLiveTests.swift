/// §12 vector 53 — the half of `dispatch.key`'s effect rule that no unit test can

///         swift test --filter HostKeyDispatchLiveTests
///
/// The executor read the focused element's `AXValue` either side of every key it
/// posted and reported `suspected_noop` whenever it had not moved. For `type`
/// that is the right question asked of the right element. For a *key* it is a
/// question about something else entirely, and the answer is "unchanged" whether
/// the key landed or not.
///
/// It survived a full unit matrix because a fake `AXUIElement` has no value to
/// read: both sides come back `nil`, the executor takes its own "nothing to
/// check" arm, and the answer is the `unverifiable` the fix produces. The defect
/// is only visible against an element that really has a value, which means a real
/// text view in a real application.
///
/// **This test activates its target, and that is deliberate.** §14 records two
/// measured delivery defects: a key posted with `CGEventPostToPid` carries no
/// characters unless the caller sets them, which `InputSimulation.pressKey` does
/// not, so nothing routed through the responder chain lands; and a main-menu key
/// equivalent does not land on a background application even when it does carry
/// them, because `performKeyEquivalent:` needs a key window. Against a background
/// window every key this vector could send is a key that goes nowhere, and the
/// vector would then be measuring delivery rather than the verdict — passing for
/// the wrong reason before the fix and after it alike. Activating removes the
/// confound and reproduces the field case exactly: a model pressing `cmd+A` on
/// the document the user is looking at.
///
/// What is *not* relaxed is the executor's own invariant. The frontmost
/// application is asserted to be unchanged **across each dispatch** — the test
/// may take the foreground, the executor may not — and the application that had
/// it is put back afterwards.
///
/// The document is this test's own, in the temporary directory, because the
/// user's documents are not fixtures. TextEdit is left running; only the window
/// this test opened is closed.
///
/// Every wait here is a semaphore. `wait(for:)` and `RunLoop.run` both spin the
/// main run loop, which thaws exactly the timings a live test exists to catch —
/// the executor's main thread sits in `readLine` and spins nothing.
