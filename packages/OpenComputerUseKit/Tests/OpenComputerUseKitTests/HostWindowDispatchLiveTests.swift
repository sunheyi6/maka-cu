/// Three things here cannot be reached from a unit test, and each of them is a
/// way the executor can be green and wrong:
///
/// 1. **Whether a window moves at all.** No fake `AXUIElement` has a position,
///    so both sides of the readback come back `nil` in a unit test and the
///    executor takes its "nothing to check" arm — which is the same answer a
///    working move produces for a window that did not move.
/// 2. **Whether the window server has caught up.** The application answers
///    `AXPosition` in 3–16 ms and the window server follows 26–172 ms later, and
///    `observe` resolves its target out of the window server. An executor that
///    returns on the application's acknowledgement passes every unit vector and
///    then cannot find, in its own `observeAfter`, the window it just moved.
/// 3. **Whether anything took the foreground.** The invariant §6 rests on is
///    about the machine, and only the machine can be asked.
///
/// Every dispatch below asserts the frontmost pid across it. TextEdit and
/// Calculator are launched in the background and left running — quitting an
/// application the user may have opened is a side effect a test has no business
/// having — and every window is put back exactly where it was found.
///
/// Every wait is a semaphore. `wait(for:)` and `RunLoop.run` both spin the main
/// run loop, which thaws exactly the timings this file exists to catch: the
/// executor's main thread sits in `readLine` and spins nothing.
